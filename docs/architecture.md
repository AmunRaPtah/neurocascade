# Architecture

## Why one coupled ODE system instead of separate stages

It's tempting to simulate each layer separately: solve for drug PK, feed the
concentration curve into a receptor-binding calculation, feed that into a
circuit simulation, and so on. That works for a constant or slowly-varying
concentration, but drug concentration, receptor occupancy, and circuit state
all evolve on overlapping timescales, and occupancy depends on how much
receptor is currently free, which depends on circuit-driven feedback in
richer models. Treating the whole chain as one state vector integrated
together keeps the causality honest: everything reacts to everything else's
*current* state, not to a precomputed trace from an earlier, disconnected
simulation.

## State vector

For `d` competing ligands at one receptor site and `n` circuit nodes:

```
y = [C_1, ..., C_d,          # plasma concentration per ligand
     occ_1, ..., occ_d,       # fractional receptor occupancy per ligand
     r_1, ..., r_n]           # firing rate per circuit node
```

`Simulation.rhs(t, y)` in `engine.py` computes the derivative of the whole
vector in one pass and hands it to `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp` with
`method="RK45"`, mirroring the integration approach used in the CCT model
(`solve_ivp` + RK45 over a coupled nonlinear system).

## Receptor layer: why competitive occupancy, not a Hill equation

A simple Hill-equation occupancy curve (`occ = C / (C + EC50)`) is fine for a
single ligand at steady state, but it can't represent what happens when a
second ligand is added to a receptor pool that's already partly occupied by
the first, which is exactly the situation that matters most in this domain
(naloxone reversing fentanyl, an antagonist blocking an agonist mid-course).
`ReceptorSite` instead tracks one occupancy value per ligand from a shared
free-receptor pool:

```
d(occ_i)/dt = kon_i * C_i * (1 - sum(occ)) - koff_i * occ_i
```

so ligands actually compete for the same finite receptor, and the model can
answer "what happens if you give the antagonist five minutes after the
agonist" without any special-casing.

Activation is a signed sum: `activation = sum(occ_i * efficacy_i)`. Setting
`efficacy = 0` gives a neutral antagonist (blocks without activating);
`efficacy = 1` a full agonist; fractional values a partial agonist; negative
values an inverse agonist. This one number captures the pharmacological
category without a separate branch of code per ligand type.

## Circuit layer: Wilson-Cowan rate model

Each circuit node is a population-rate unit:

```
tau * dr/dt = -r + sigmoid(gain * (input - threshold))
```

`input` is the sum of the node's own baseline drive, weighted input from
other nodes (via the network's connectivity matrix), and, for whichever
node(s) actually carry the receptor in question, the receptor's activation
term. This is a standard, well-understood mean-field abstraction for
population activity: fine-grained enough to represent excitation/inhibition
and time-constant differences between populations, coarse enough to keep the
whole multi-region model tractable as one ODE system.

## Network layer: connectivity as a signed matrix

`CircuitNetwork.connectivity[i, j]` is the weight of the projection from
node `j` onto node `i` (positive = excitatory, negative = inhibitory). This
is deliberately just a matrix, not a graph library dependency: the
`v0` scenario only needs four nodes, and a bigger connectome can still be
expressed the same way (see `docs/build-slice.md`-style handoffs in sibling
projects for the "core stays dependency-light" convention this follows).

## Behavior layer: linear readout by design

`BehaviorReadout` is a named weighted sum over node rates. This is the
simplest thing that could possibly work, and that's the point for v0: it's
interpretable and checkable by hand (you can predict its output from the
circuit weights alone), so it won't hide a modeling mistake behind a fitted
black box. The natural upgrade path, once real behavioral endpoint data
exists to fit against, is a learned nonlinear decoder; that's out of scope
until there's something real to calibrate it to.

## Second scenario: D2 dopamine receptor / basal ganglia indirect pathway

`scenarios.d2_*` reuses every class unmodified. D2 receptors are Gi-coupled,
same as mu-opioid, just sitting on a different node in a different circuit:
striatal "indirect pathway" medium spiny neurons (MSNs) instead of VTA
GABAergic interneurons. Dopamine acting at D2 suppresses those MSNs, which
disinhibits GPe, which inhibits STN, which reduces excitatory drive onto
GPi, which disinhibits thalamus, so the same "Gi-coupled receptor
disinhibits something two or three synapses downstream" motif as
mu-opioid, just relayed one hop further. `d2_dopamine_ligands()` gives
dopamine efficacy=1.0 (agonist) and haloperidol efficacy=0.0 (antagonist),
competing at one shared D2 pool exactly like fentanyl/naloxone at mu; the
readout (`locomotor_activity_readout()`, weighted on the `Thalamus` node)
reflects the indirect pathway's real role in motor facilitation, and is
deliberately not framed as a "psychosis index": this scenario models the
mesolimbic drug class's motor/basal-ganglia side, which is also the
mechanistic link to antipsychotics' extrapyramidal side effects, not the
mesolimbic antipsychotic-efficacy side.

One tuning lesson worth recording: the first parameter draft made GPi
saturate near its sigmoid's ceiling at baseline (net input far outside
[-1, 1] before the gain multiplier), so it stopped responding to anything
upstream of it and the agonist/antagonist barely changed the readout at
all. `basal_ganglia_indirect_pathway_network()`'s `baseline_input` values
are chosen so every node sits near the sensitive part of its sigmoid at
its own steady state; this is a generally applicable check for any new
multi-node relay chain added to this codebase, not a one-off fix.

## Third scenario, and why it needed a small engine extension: GABA-A / benzodiazepine

Benzodiazepines (e.g. diazepam) are a different pharmacological shape than
mu-opioid or D2: they do not compete with GABA for GABA's own orthosteric
binding site. They bind a separate allosteric site on the GABA-A receptor
and act as a positive allosteric modulator (PAM): GABA still gates the
channel, and diazepam just makes GABA more effective at it. Flumazenil, by
contrast, really does compete with diazepam at that separate benzodiazepine
site, which is the actual mechanism of benzodiazepine-overdose reversal, but
it does very little on its own since it isn't displacing GABA from
anywhere.

That splits into two questions the codebase had to answer honestly before
adding this scenario:

1. **Does the diazepam/flumazenil interaction fit `ReceptorSite` as-is?**
   Yes, unmodified. Diazepam and flumazenil genuinely share one pool at the
   benzodiazepine site, exactly the competitive-occupancy relationship
   `ReceptorSite` already models for fentanyl/naloxone. No change to
   `receptor.py` was needed.
2. **Does coupling that occupancy into circuit dynamics fit the existing
   `Simulation.coupling` mechanism?** No. `coupling` adds receptor
   activation directly and additively to a node's drive, which is right for
   a receptor that itself gates a current (mu-opioid, D2), but wrong for an
   allosteric modulator that has no drive of its own: it only changes the
   *gain* of an already-present GABAergic synapse. Using `coupling` here
   would have modeled diazepam as if it had an independent excitatory or
   inhibitory action, which is not how benzodiazepines work and would have
   been a mechanistically dishonest shortcut just to reuse the existing
   mechanism.

So `engine.py` gained one small, additive-only extension:
`Simulation(..., connection_modulation={...})`, a dict of
`(post_node, pre_node) -> gain`. Each evaluation, the targeted connectivity
entry is scaled by `1 + gain * activation` (via a new optional
`connectivity` override argument on `CircuitNetwork.rhs`, defaulting to
`self.connectivity` so every existing call site is unaffected) instead of
being added to a node's drive. This is a `Simulation`/`CircuitNetwork`-level
change only; `ReceptorSite`/`Ligand` are untouched, and a receptor can use
`coupling`, `connection_modulation`, both, or neither, depending on its
actual mechanism.

`scenarios.gaba_a_*` puts this to use in a local-interneuron -> basolateral
amygdala (BLA) -> central amygdala (CeA) circuit: local GABAergic
interneurons tonically inhibit BLA principal neurons, whose output drives
CeA, the standard fear/anxiety output relay. Diazepam potentiates the
interneuron -> BLA synapse (via `connection_modulation`), suppressing BLA
and, downstream, the `anxiety_index` readout, consistent with
benzodiazepines' clinical anxiolytic effect. Flumazenil given after
diazepam displaces some of diazepam's occupancy from the shared
benzodiazepine-site pool and partially reverses the effect, the same
overdose-reversal mechanism as the mu-opioid/naloxone case, and, like that
case, imperfectly and temporarily, since flumazenil's own illustrative
clearance is faster than diazepam's.

## What v0 gets right, and what it doesn't (yet)

**Mechanistically faithful:**
- Mu-opioid receptors are Gi-coupled and expressed on VTA GABAergic
  interneurons that tonically inhibit VTA dopamine neurons; an agonist there
  suppresses the GABA node, disinhibiting dopamine firing. That's the
  textbook opioid-reward mechanism and it's what the coupling in
  `scenarios.mu_opioid_coupling()` encodes.
- Competitive antagonism at a shared receptor pool is exactly how naloxone
  reverses opioid effects: it doesn't undo anything downstream, it takes the
  receptor back.
- D2 receptors are Gi-coupled on striatal indirect-pathway MSNs; the same
  disinhibition logic reused one hop further down the basal ganglia's
  indirect pathway (see above).
- Benzodiazepines are positive allosteric modulators of GABA-A, not
  orthosteric competitors with GABA; representing that mechanism required
  the small `connection_modulation` extension described above rather than
  reusing `coupling` as-is (see above).

**Explicitly not yet real:**
- `kon`/`koff`/`ke`/circuit `tau`/connection weights in `scenarios.py` are
  hand-set to get qualitative behavior right, not sourced from a specific
  Ki/kon/koff or PK dataset. They should not be cited as measured values.
  Calibrating these against literature (or, longer-term, fitting them
  Bayesian-style the way the CCT model's 14 parameters were fit against a
  literature screen) is the next real piece of work, not a formality. This
  applies equally to the mu-opioid, D2, and GABA-A scenarios.
- Each scenario in v0 models one receptor site and one circuit in isolation
  (three separate scenarios, not three interacting ones). A real drug
  usually hits several receptor subtypes across several regions
  simultaneously, and a real circuit carries several receptor types at
  once; the classes here (`ReceptorSite`, `CircuitNetwork`, `coupling`,
  `connection_modulation`) are general enough to support combining them in
  one `Simulation`, but that hasn't been built or tested yet.
